Exercise 1 — Simple HTML & JS

Goal
- Learn basic HTML structure, edit text, and run tiny JavaScript.

Tasks (do them in `exercises/exercise-1/index.html`)
1. Open the file in a browser (double-click or `Open File` in your editor).
2. Replace the header text "Hello — replace this with your name!" with your own name or a short greeting.
3. Change the button label from "Change background color" to something else (e.g., "Make it colorful").
4. (Optional) Edit the `colors` array in the script to add one or two colors you like.

How to check your work
- After saving, reload the page in the browser.
- Click the button: the background should change and the `info` box updates.

When you're done
- Tell me what you changed, or paste the updated `index.html` content here.
- I'll review and give feedback. If everything's correct, we'll mark this done and move to a slightly harder exercise.

Hints
- HTML elements live between `<body>...</body>`.
- Strings in JavaScript use quotes: `"like this"` or `'like this'`.
- If something breaks, open the browser DevTools console (F12) and paste any errors here.
